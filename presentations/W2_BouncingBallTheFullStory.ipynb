    "\n",
    "From our basic classroom physics we know that a ball in a state of rest (i.e. zero velocity) that \n",
    "is released from height $h_0$ will drop towards the ground with acceleration with an acceleration \n",
    "due to gravity $g$, that usually has the value of $9.81 m/s^2$. However, when making that \n",
    "simple statement we must be aware of the implicit assumptions that this entails: \n",
    "- There are no fluid effects such as *bouyancy* or *drag*. \n",
    "- We are on planet earth and somewhere near its surface, and on an altitude and latitude \n",
    "    where $g=9.81 m/s^2$ is an okay approximation \n",
    "    (we know that is on our planet is could anywhere from $9.764 m/s^2$ to $9.834 m/s^2$). \n",
    "- The diameter, mass, and color of the ball does not matter\n",
    "- The ball is perfectly spherical and the ground is perfectly flat and level (so that when dropped from rest, it will bounce perfectly upwards) \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**Lesson 1: Always state your assumptions**</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "Having stated our assumption we now proceed with the equations of motion. We\n",
    "know that a ball dropped from rest (in a vacuum, or with negligible fluid\n",
    "effects), will be subject to [constant translational acceleration in a straight\n",
    "line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion#Uniform_acceleration).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence \n",
    "$$v=v_0-g t$$\n",
    "Here $v$ is the vertical velocity, and v_0 is the initial vertical velocity. Our coordinate system is oriented such that\n",
    "the positive sense is away from the surface of the earth, hence the -ve effect\n",
    "of earth's acceleration. We can integrate the above equation to find the hight\n",
    "of the ball. It will come to \n",
    "$$h=h_o+v_0t -\\frac{1}{2}gt^2$$\n",
    "Where $h$ is the vertical hight above ground and $h_0$ is the initial hight. \n",
    "We know that when the ball hits the ground, it will lose some energy on the\n",
    "bounce. This can be expressed as\n",
    "$$v_a=-c v_b$$\n",
    "Where $v_b$ is the velocity immediately prior to collision, $v_a$ is the velocity immediately after collision,and  $c$ is the [coefficient or restitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_restitution). "
